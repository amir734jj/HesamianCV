                            <p>I was born and raised in a very small town (<a
                                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgan">Gorgan, Iran</a>) which is located in
                                South-East of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea">Caspian Sea</a>. I
                                am
                                very passionate about computers. My interest in computers started when my father bought
                                me a computer for the first time. My first computer was based on <a
                                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80486">Intel 80486</a> running
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> and I used to play <a
                                        href="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/the-lion-king/">'The Lion
                                    King'</a> on it. My interest in computers went to whole new level when
                                I was a high school freshman and I visited my brother's dorm room, and there I met guy
                                who was finishing his Masters in Computer Science. He showed me a trick to <a
                                        href="http://www.davidtan.org/hacking-cracking-windows-xp-login-password/">by-pass
                                    windows XP's login password</a>.
                                Right after my interaction with that guy, I started learning programming in Visual Basic
                                and I made simple applications using that platform. Then I participated in various
                                Mathematics and Programming competitions across
                                the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golestan_Province">province</a>. Between ages
                                of 15 to 16, I got heavily involved in writing websites and themes for CMS systems like
                                WordPress, in addition to setting up my
                                own VPN/Proxy/Socks Services and doing reseller web hosting.</p>
                            <p>One months after my 17 birthday (summer of 2010) I moved to U.S. Shorewood, WI. I tried
                                to enroll for High School here in U.S. but all public High Schools rejected me as I
                                already got my High School diploma one year early
                                (at age of 17) back in Iran. Therefore, I had no other option but to sign up in a small
                                private High School to improve my English proficiency. In the summer of 2011, I started
                                a summer internship at Swick Technology
                                located in Wauwatosa, WI where I became fascinated with technology and programming to
                                the point that I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science at <a
                                        href="http://www4.uwm.edu/">UW-Milwaukee</a>.</p>
                            <p>I started working with Dr. Pradeep Rohatgi in early 2013 (until Spring of 2015) at UWM's
                                Center for Composites and Advance Materials Manufacturing (<a
                                        href="http://camm.ceas.uwm.edu/">CAMM</a>). I worked directly with Dr.
                                Rohatgi, a UWM Distinguished Professor, and also Dr. Roshan (Entrepreneur and Industry
                                Expert) to implement the MAGMA software package, and use it to predict the results of
                                solidification of different materials and
                                predict behavior/results with variation of shape, temperature, Mold types and more.
                                Additionally, I had to teach graduate students (who were taking Material Engineering-732
                                & Metal Casting Engineering-456 as well as
                                people in our group) how to use the software. The use of MAGMA software gave the team an
                                upper hand as they could simulate the process of solidification. Therefore, they can
                                predict the results and fix any possible
                                errors before they happen. This translates to saving time and money. In particular, over
                                my working experiences at CAMM, I utilized my knowledge in Computational Geometry and
                                Differential Equations (especially partial
                                differential equations).</p>
                            <p>I also was involved with Dr. Rohatgi's team regarding the <a
                                    href="http://govsbizplancontest.com/">Governor of Wisconsin's Business Plan
                                Contest</a> in both 2013 and 2014. In particular, I became especially interested in
                                Business Plan preparation. I observed and contributed to the process of preparing
                                business plans and presenting to venture investors. That process was so fascinating for
                                me that I decided to take Innovation and Commercialization
                                class (CS657) to advance his knowledge. In particular, I am most interested in the
                                process of commercialization and creating a successful enterprise.</p>
                            <p>In summer of 2015, I was an Intern Application Developer at <a
                                    href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com/">Northwestern mutual</a> (Enterprise
                                Project Solution department. OBA project. Milwaukee downtown), and I was helping
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">scrum team</a> by:
                                Working mostly with Underscore.js, Backbone.js, and Backbone-forms module for front-end
                                of outside business activity wizard web
                                application, and also Node.js / Express.js for proof of concept work. As well as Adding
                                grunt and bower to build the project's dependencies, Minify Java-Script files and
                                perform package management and versioning. In
                                addition to converting all of the outside business activity disclosure forms to the
                                relational database format (IBM DB2 and SQLite), in addition to design wizard steps and
                                paths to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(software)">wizard web
                                    application</a> fetch data and create forms. Lastly, I worked briefly with Java EE
                                and Web-Sphere for back-end (WebUI and Web Services). I learned many valuable
                                experiences by working there including: collaboration, being an effective
                                team member and successfully delivering a software to the client.</p>
                            <p>I have finished my Undergraduate requirements in December 2014, and I took CS-657 and
                                CS-530 (Computer Networks Laboratory) as a Graduate level, before officially starting
                                Masters in Computer Science in Fall of 2015.</p>
